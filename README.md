## ðŸ§­ Project Overview

The SUB-FOLD system enables uncertainty-based interpretation and integration of forest disturbance data from various sources. It combines:

- Probabilistic forest change detection
- Manual interpreter input using high-resolution imagery
- Post-processing for aggregation and validation
- Integration with machine learning models
